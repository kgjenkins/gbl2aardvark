# Notes, questions, and observations

## gbl_resourceClass_sm (Required)
- why are these plural?

## dcat_theme_sm (Optional)
- should these be capitalized, or lowercase?

## dcat_centroid
- why is this a string `"46.4218,-94.087"` instead of an array of numbers? `[46.4218,-94.087]`

## gbl_wxsIdentifier_s (Conditional)
- why isn't this stored within dct_references? (where WMS/WFS are)
- why does [doc](https://opengeometadata.org/docs/ogm-aardvark/wxs-identifier) say "Multiplicity = 0-1 or 1-1"?

## id (Required)
- move this to the top?

## dct_identifier_sm (Recommended)
- move this to the top, too?
